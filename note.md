# PCB updates note

[Update]: ESP32-S3 MCU control circuit version 2
- Made pin assignment for motor connnections 
- Each DC motor uses 5 pins (Motor Hall Phase A & B, Motor direction control port A & B, PWM pin)
- Linear Actuator uses 3 pins (PWM pin, direcetion control pin)
- Added testing output pins for the MCU control circuit (for motors specifically)
- Reduced the numbers of ports for other programmable GPIOs
- The output pins are Connector_Pinhead (male pins)
